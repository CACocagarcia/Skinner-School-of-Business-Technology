           <p id="maintext">
                This month we had a brand new activity for Trevecca Nazarene University and the Skinner School of Business and Technology. We hosted a local Hackathon for our undergraduate students.
               <br>Thanks to MLH (Major League Hacking), we are able to host our first Hackathon at the Skinner School of Business and Technology.
               <br>For people who are not familiar to what a hackathon is, a hackathon an event in which different students meet to engage in collective computer programming.
               <br>Different students came in and presented their projects to compete for a prize.
               <br>We also had an API module presention by undergraduate student Carlos Coca. He also presented his Weather API, which is the the program he presented in Vanderbilt's past hackathon.
               <br>Of course, we had winners. Tasha Lane, Melvin Valdez de La Roca and Brandon de Leon won the contest with their responsive website about ACM (Association for Computing Machinery).
               <br>We would like to thank to each and every students that participated in the contes and each student that came to spectate all of the programs that were presented at our hackathon.
               <br>We would also like to thank our professors in the Technology Department for motivating our students to strive for greatness and to participate in activities like the hackathon that help them get better technological skills.
