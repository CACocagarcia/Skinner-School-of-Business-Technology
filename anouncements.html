                  <h1>Upcoming Event</h1>
                <p>I would like to invite you to attend or volunteer at Trevecca's first Local Hack day. It is going to be a 12 hour hackathon and we would greatly appreciate it if you could stay the whole 12 hours but if you can only attend/volunteer for less, then that would be greatly appreciated as well. You do not need to know programming or any technical skills in order to attend or volunteer. 

                This event will take place in the Boone Business Building from 8am to 9pm.

                 Some roles we need for volunteering:
- someone to keep up with social media updates
- setup/cleanup
- helping the attendees 
- helping with the workshops
and many more</p>
